             Sephirot Hokma is solemn,prudent and collected but can come off as rude.

             a major role in the making of Lobotomy Corporation

                The Record team is in charge of managing employee progression,
                maintaining the facility's extensive collection of information, 
                and acting as a hub for data collection and analysis that informs the entire 
                corporation's operations.
                To say this department is important is an understatement due to it record everything.
                This department is similair to the Central Command department in the sense of 
                employees sent. However some of the most dangerous abnormalities are kept here.
