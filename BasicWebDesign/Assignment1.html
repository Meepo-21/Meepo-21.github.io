        <h3>How'd Oktober fest come about?</h3> 
            <p>Oktober fest first started on 1961 in La crosse, Wisconsin where the main event is held to this day.
            The event was made by the Greater La Crosse Chamber of Commerce and the G. Heileman Brewing Company to raise local moral by making a lively festival. 
            This all started from the reccomendation of two men working in the brewing company,suggesting a event similar to the one in Munich, Germany.
            The name "Oktober Fest" was registered in 1962 and federally trademarked in 1963. To this day La Crosse Oktober fest,nicknamed Das beste remains the largest and most popular Oktober fest.</p>
