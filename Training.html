             Sephirot Hod is kind,caring,and a bit of a worrywart. 
             So although she may seem possibly annoying,she is the one who cares for you the most than 
             any other sephirot.

                The Training team is in charge of composing and regulating company policies 
                and various management procedures.
                Also are in charge with running general-purpose training programs to help
                employees adapt to their new departments.
                Employees sent here tend to be higher level around 3-5,usually 3,
                as the anomalies here are quite dangerous
                but also a mixture of less hostile anomalies.
                Typically employees are sent here after being in the information department 
                due to their higher level and experience gained.
